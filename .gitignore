# For a library or tool, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; if you have a vendored
# environment, however, you should not ignore it.
# .python-version

# pipenv
# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case you are using Docker, you might want to ignore it, so that base image updates
# do not affect your local environment.
